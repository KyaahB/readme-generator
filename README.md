## Creator's Information/Notes

My motivation to create this project was to not only succeed in completing the assignment but also to become a possible contributing factor in being the help that I wish I had when I'm the user.

I created this ReadMe Generator to aid users on their project creating journeys so that this one simple but big part could be a breeze. Which in turn, will allow them to spend more time and save thier brain power for the actual project.

While building this app I learned that things sometimes aren't as difficult as they seem. Most things, especially in coding just take patience, concentration and an open mind. They can be tricky but guidance helps a lot. 

If you have any further questions or just need more of an understanding of this app, I can be reached at [Creator's email](kyaahh@gmail.com).
